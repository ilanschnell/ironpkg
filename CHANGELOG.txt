* allowing a placeholder '{ARCH}' in the list of indexed repositories
  in the configuration file which gets substituted by 'amd64' or 'x86',
  depending on the architecture of the current interpreter.

  more than one interpreter installed.

  enpkg command is still available and now called easy_manage, because it
  can manage setuptools installed packages.



All earlier versions
--------------------
All earlier versions of Enstaller used a completely different architecture
and design and were quickly deprecated from active usage due to instability
problems.
